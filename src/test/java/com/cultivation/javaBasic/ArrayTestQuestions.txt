What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?

Why the test failed at first?
The test failed because the array for push, pop stack methods are not yet constructed.

Why you corrected the test that way?
I corrected the test by manually inputting the expected value when doing the operations or by filling up the methods.

Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
None
